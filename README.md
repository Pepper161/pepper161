## Hi, I'm Pepper

A Computer Science student and product-oriented full-stack developer.

I focus on building early-stage products with real-world constraints in mind, not just how to implement features, but how they are operated, maintained, and sustained over time.

Currently, I'm involved in:
- **Locipe**: a recipe-based web product designed with scalability and cost-awareness
- **Kopi Chat**: a student community platform, built with both development and operations in mind

## Projects

### Locipe
[https://locipe.com/](https://locipe.com/)

A recipe-based web product designed with a strong focus on real-world constraints.

I'm responsible for the overall product design and implementation, including:
- system and feature design
- full-stack implementation
- specification and behavior decisions
- operational decision-making and cost-aware feature planning

Rather than maximizing features, I prioritize stability, predictable costs, and maintainability, so the product can continue to run and evolve over time.

### Kopi Chat
[https://kopi-chat.com/](https://kopi-chat.com/)

A community platform for students in Malaysia.

My role covers:
- application design and implementation
- specification decisions for user-facing features
- defining platform rules and moderation-related behaviors

In this project, I focus on building systems that remain manageable as the number of users grows, balancing usability with operational simplicity.

## Applied AI (Selective Use)

In some parts of my projects, I work with AI-related features such as:
- LLM-based text generation
- image generation pipelines
- prompt and output-structure design

I treat AI as one of many tools and carefully consider cost, reliability, and operational impact before integrating it into a product.

---

## Current Focus

- Building and operating early-stage products with real users
- Improving design and implementation skills through practical development
- Learning how technical decisions affect long-term maintainability

I'm open to internships and opportunities where I can contribute to real products, especially in environments that value ownership and practical problem-solving.
