## 🚀 Projects

### Locipe
🔗 https://locipe.com/

A recipe-based web product designed with strong awareness of real-world constraints.

I am responsible for:
- system and feature design
- full-stack implementation
- specification and behavior decisions
- operational decision-making and cost-aware feature planning

Rather than maximizing features, I prioritize stability, predictable costs, and maintainability,
so the product can continue to run and evolve over time.

### Kopi Chat
🔗 https://kopi-chat.com/

A student community platform in Malaysia.

My role includes:
- application design and implementation
- specification decisions for user-facing features
- defining platform rules and moderation-related behaviors

The focus is on keeping the system manageable as usage grows,
balancing usability with operational simplicity.

## 🤖 Applied AI (Selective Use)

In some parts of my projects, I work with:
- LLM-based text generation
- image generation pipelines
- prompt and output-structure design

I treat AI as one tool among many, and evaluate its cost, reliability,
and operational impact before integrating it into a product.

## 🎯 Current Focus

- Building and operating early-stage products with real users
- Improving design and implementation skills through practical development
- Learning how technical decisions affect long-term maintainability

I'm open to internships and opportunities where I can contribute to real products,
especially in environments that value ownership and practical problem-solving.
